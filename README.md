# Phone-Interactive-Voice-Response-IVR-System

An application using KooKoo.in to create the following flow for incoming calls :
 When the user calls the number, asks them if they are male(1) or female(2)
 If the user chooses male, then asks them if they are above 21(1), or below(2). For
females ask them if they are above 18(1) or below(2)
 If the user chooses 1 above, plays the message - "You are an adult", else plays the
message "Minors are not allowed".
 End the call

I have used ngrok(https://ngrok.com/) to make my code publicly accessible.

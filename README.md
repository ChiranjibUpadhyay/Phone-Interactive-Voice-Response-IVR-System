# Phone-Interactive-Voice-Response-IVR-System

An application using KooKoo.in to create the following flow for incoming calls :
1. When the user calls the number, asks them if they are male(1) or female(2)
2. If the user chooses male, then asks them if they are above 21(1), or below(2). For females asks them if they are above 18(1) or below(2)
3. If the user chooses 1 above, plays the message - "You are an adult", else plays the message "Minors are not allowed".
4. Ends the call

I have used ngrok(https://ngrok.com/) to make my code publicly accessible.
